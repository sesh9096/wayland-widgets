#+title: Experiments in Wayland

*WIP*

A system monitor and widgets using wayland protocols

Dependencies:
- cairo
- pango

Build Dependencies:
- zig-wayland
- wayland-protocols
- cairo-devel
- pango-devel

* Implementation
To create a surface:
1. Create Context
2. Generate Surfaces
3. Draw Widgets
** Frame
1. Handle Input events
   1. Reset input state
   2. apply input events to widgets
2. Reset Widgets in Surface
3. Create widgets
4. Draw to Surface
** On Id's
Id's are used to uniquely identify widgets in a surface for purposes of handling input.
They are created by hashing several times of data as specified by =IdGenerator=.

almost all fields in IdGenerator are optional and used as follows:
1. if =id= is set, use it *directly*
2. if =src= or =extra= are set, use these and type data as hash
3. otherwise, use =type=, =parent=, =ptr=, =string=, as hash, these should not be set directly by the user
